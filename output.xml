                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The new animated series, <em><strong>"ALVINNN!!! and The Chipmunks"</strong></em>, created by Janice Karman, will take viewers on a roller-coaster ride of music, laughter and stories geared to entertain four generations of "The Chipmunks" fans. Presented for the first time in glorious CGI, the series features ground-breaking animation and a new, original Chipmunk song in every episode. The series is an animated version of a prime-time sitcom and reflects the trials and tribulations of a single parent, David Seville, trying to raise six hyper-active Chipmunks. Like most parents, Dave's patience will be pushed to the limit, forcing him to end most sentences in "ALVINNN!!!"</p><p>Alvin, Simon and Theodore are brothers who tour the world as famous rock stars and still manage to go to school. Completely normal... right? Did I also mention that they're Chipmunks? Along with their best friends, The Chipettes, Alvin and his chipmunk brothers cause tons of trouble on and off the stage while their dad, Dave, tries to manage these three rambunctious rodents, while writing all of their hit songs. Alvin, Theodore, and Simon are so different, it's hard to believe that they came from the same litter. With little voices and BIG personalities, there will be no shortage of adventures when these Chipmunks hit the stage!<br /></p>]]></description>

Episodes usually start with the story of an artist's upbringing before moving into the trials and tribulations faced as the subject searched for the big break early in his or her music career.

Like most working women, her hands are already full, balancing a demanding and dangerous job and a family — husband Matt (Jonathan Scarfe), and teenagers Jeff (Mitchell Kummen) and Rachel (Natasha Calis). But when she and her partner, Devin (Dion Johnstone), must arrest her brother, Tim (Luke Perry), for aggravated assault, her world drastically changes as Tim is convicted and sent to prison leaving his two teenagers Cameron (Rhys Matthew Bond) and Mariah (Matreya Scarrwener) teetering on the brink of foster care. Having done the right thing as an officer of the law, Allison now feels compelled to do the right thing as a sister and aunt; she brings Tim's two very unhappy teens into her home. Squeezing four teenagers under one roof proves to be an additional test of Allison's strength and patience. It won't be easy for her husband, her children or Tim's kids either. In addition to investigating local crimes, the UP Original Series <em><strong>"Ties That Bind"</strong></em> will also focus on the joys and struggles of the teens as they adjust to their new home, their new high school, make new friends and experience love, romance, anger and jealousy.</p>]]></description>

At the end of each episode, Kerri and Chris will each pick the one person they connected with the most to be their "keeper", and ask them to remain on the island. As sexy new singles arrive every week, vying for the coveted "keeper" spots, initial connections will be put to the test and deeper feelings may begin to develop.</p><p>Can Kerri and Chris handle the competition? Or will temptation and jealousy run rampant on the island?

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>"Impastor" is a dark comedy from Christopher Vane ("Wings") starring Michael Rosenbaum as Buddy Dobbs, a slacker on the run from his gambling debt. Just when he's about to end his misery and jump off a bridge, a reverend shows up and talks him down. When the reverend slips off the bridge and falls to his death, he leaves Buddy with the unlikely opportunity to steal the man's identity and pose as the new gay pastor of a small, tight-knight town, leaving his bartender ex-girlfriend Leanne (Aimee Garcia) to clean up the huge mess he left behind. Buddy begins to settle into his new life as a pastor with the help of his preppy new assistant Dora (Sara Rue), alluring church treasurer Alexa (Mircea Monroe) and enthusiastic secretary Russell (Mike Kosinski) - but the church president, Alden Schmidt (David Rasche) senses that something isn't quite right. Curing sex crazed teenagers, stealing kids' weed and reading Bible scripture may not be a bad gig for Buddy after all. Only time will tell how long he can keep up the façade. </p>]]></description>
